You've stumbled upon the ramblings of Steve Hartzog. Steve is a professional JavaScript web developer who loves node.js (but like most smart people, he knows that it should be called io.js).

Steve has done many things in his life. Starting with BASIC on an old TRS Color Computer II... he was there for DR-DOS, DOS, Windows, Red Hat Linux, Mac OS X... and now chooses Ubuntu. Althought he claims to really love Ubuntu, he's usually pulling his hair out about 'stupid stuff that should just f!!!!ng work'.

Also, Steve is the co-founder and CTO of [SBC Tech Partners, LLC](http://www.sbctechpartners.com/). Perhaps you need someone to drive your website or your web team to new heights?
